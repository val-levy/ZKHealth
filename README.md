# 🧬 ZKPS – Zero-Knowledge Patient Sharing  
**Built for Stellar Consensus Hackathon 2025**  
_Web3 UX doesn’t have to suck. We proved it._

---

## 🔥 Why: The Narrative

**What we’re building**  
ZKPS is a privacy-preserving healthcare dapp that enables patients to **selectively prove** the existence of off-chain medical documents—like vaccine records or diagnosis PDFs—using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Patients can **share proof of a file without exposing its contents**, and providers can **verify integrity** without storing sensitive data.

**What it fixes**  
Web3 UX is clunky—wallets, keys, and complex flows slow everything down. We built a **frictionless onboarding** system using **Stellar Passkeys**, removed wallet interactions, and created a seamless, mobile-first experience that just works. Patients can login with Face ID, upload files, and approve share requests—no crypto knowledge required.

**Who it helps**  
Patients managing sensitive health records and healthcare providers who need to verify authenticity without compromising patient privacy.

**Why it’s important**  
In the age of AI and healthcare digitization, **privacy and portability** of data matters more than ever. ZKPS is built to scale for real-world adoption with **decentralized proof and familiar UX**.

**Value proposition**  
🧠 **ZK privacy** + 🪪 **passkey identity** + 🌐 **on-chain anchoring** = Real UX breakthrough for Web3 healthcare.

## 📄 Technical Design Docs Overview

> _See full doc at: [`docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/your-team/zkps/docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)_

### System Overview  
A patient-facing app enabling passkey-authenticated file uploads, ZK hashing, proof generation, and on-chain anchoring—verifiable by providers.

### Architecture Diagram  
_(Add flowchart here)_  
- User → Uploads file → Poseidon hash → ZK proof → Send + store proof  
- Stellar stores hash in `manageData`  
- Providers verify hash from shared file + compare

### Components  
- `frontend/`: React app with login, upload, sharing views  
- `circuits/`: Circom ZK circuit, input.json generator  
- `stellar/`: Rust contract logic + deployment  
- `scripts/`: CLI for interacting with contracts

### Design Choices  
- **Off-chain file storage** to ensure GDPR/HIPAA compliance  
- **Poseidon** for ZK-friendly hashing  
- **Stellar `manageData`** to store tamper-proof hash anchors  
- **Passkeys** eliminate wallet UX friction

### Events & Interactions  
- File uploaded → hash stored on-chain  
- ZK proof verified on provider dashboard  
- No blockchain literacy required from user
